Client - req/res port(3000) server
|
req - site (SPA) index.html - main.js


server hosts business logic

each request uses thread of cpu and holding that thread raises cpu%
req is not closed until response is received

model - nouns - game
service - verbs + business (game) logic
routes - map uri to service

routes -> services -> model

map out req/res on paper to server chutes and ladders (entire game)

openAPI lets you write text descriptions of the req res of your application
swagger takes the text descriptions and makes a UI for others to view how your applications works without any information about your application
